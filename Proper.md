This as a markdown checklist, use as input for Cursor, or adapt for your team’s sprints/demo docs!

Ticket Workflow Builder – Cursor + Firebase (with Apple-style UI)
1. Firestore Collections and Data Model
 1.1. Define a tickets collection in Firestore
 Fields: requestedBy, assignedTo, status, description, location, urgency, attachments, activityLog, etc.
 1.2. Define a suppliers collection. Allow linking suppliers to tickets.
 1.3. For each ticket, create a quotes subcollection/array for supplier quotes.
 1.4. Add buildingEvents collection for scheduled work/tasks.
 1.5. Write and test Firestore security rules for all collections (role-based, least privilege, no open access).
2. New Ticket Creation
 2.1. Build a “Raise New Ticket” form in React/TypeScript (Cursor).   - Minimalist, distraction-free inputs (Apple-style clarity: large fields, plentiful whitespace).   - Fields: issue details, location, urgency (pills for choices), attachment upload (drag & drop).
 2.2. On submit, add ticket to Firestore with initial status "New".
 2.3. Trigger notification (in-app + email/flag) to manager on new ticket.
 2.4. Build manager dashboard view for all “New” tickets with instant open/click-to-detail.
3. Supplier Quoting Process
 3.1. Manager multi-selects suppliers for the ticket (visually styled list, avatars for identity).
 3.2. Send quote requests (templated, clear call-to-action) by email/message.
 3.3. Log quote requests in quotes array/subcollection.
 3.4. Build supplier screen/form for quote submission (clean, focused input).
 3.5. Log all quote responses to the ticket document.
 3.6. Tickets auto-update status at each quote phase ("Quote Requested" → "Quote Received").
4. Quote Review & Contracting
 4.1. Manager dashboard for comparing quotes (side-by-side, sortable by price/terms).
 4.2. Allow manager to request revision or decline.
 4.3. One-click “Select Supplier” to trigger contract/PO creation (display/preview in modal before sending).
 4.4. Ticket status updates to "PO Sent" or "Contracted".
5. Scheduling Work
 5.1. UI for mutually agreeing to date/time with supplier (Apple-style date picker, clear timezone handling).
 5.2. Confirmation flow for schedule (optionally shown to requester/client).
 5.3. Linked event auto-added in buildingEvents (Firestore), visible in manager and supplier calendar views.
 5.4. Notification/reminders via in-app and/or email/messages before start.
 5.5. Ticket status auto-updates to "Scheduled".
6. Completion & Confirmation
 6.1. Supplier uploads completion evidence (quick camera/photo integration, preview before upload, clear status indicator).
 6.2. Manager/client can review and confirm (or request follow-up).
 6.3. Status auto-updates to "Complete" or "Closed", with timestamp.
 6.4. Prompt for feedback (modal, minimal friction, simple smiley/star for quick review).
7. Feedback & Archive
 7.1. Collect client satisfaction (score + open comment field, crisp confirmation screen).
 7.2. Store/link feedback to ticket and supplier.
 7.3. Auto-archive ticket; visibly marked as closed in dashboard, can be restored/viewed for audit/history.
8. General/Parallel Tasks
 8.1. All status changes/actions are logged in an activityLog (timestamped array in each ticket).
 8.2. Enforce permissions: managers only for privileged actions, suppliers only see/respond on their own quotes, requesters see/track their tickets.
 8.3. Implement notification flows using in-app alerts (banner/chip), email (Apple Mail-like style), or Firestore status flags.
9. Testing & QA
 9.1. Test as manager, supplier, client (requester), switching roles in development.
 9.2. Validate security rules in Firestore for privacy, least privilege.
 9.3. Confirm activity logs and full ticket lifecycle are tracked and readable.
10. Dashboard Requirements (Manager)
 10.1. Home dashboard: snapshot at a glance (cards with total tickets by status, visual donut/pie/bar representation, mini-calendar of upcoming events).
 10.2. “My Task List”: all tickets assigned, events managed/added by this user, quick actions (mark done, send reminder, edit).
 10.3. Notification bell with history (animated, easy to scan and dismiss).
 10.4. Responsive design: works fluidly on Mac, iPad, and iPhone screens.
 10.5. Accessibility: supports keyboard navigation, readable color contrast, dynamic font sizing.
11. UI Requirements (Apple Design Philosophy)
 11.1. White/neutral backgrounds, clean sans-serif fonts, use of depth (shadows, layers) to create focus.
 11.2. Animations and transitions are smooth, meaningful, and never distracting (subtle fade/slide, attention to feedback state).
 11.3. All actions are clearly labeled (buttons with text/icons), minimal “hidden” flows.
 11.4. Modals for detail/edit, with safe “cancel” and clear confirm.
 11.5. Success/errors provide pleasant, human feedback (haptic if on mobile, soft vibration/animation on confirm).
 11.6. Progressive disclosure: basic info first, details one tap away (no busy screens).
 11.7. Use bold color/contrast only for status (e.g., urgent ticket = red dot/chip, neutral for complete).
 11.8. Microinteractions (subtle icon bounces, soft shine on active buttons) where appropriate.
12. Bonus: Integration/Export
 12.1. Provide option for manager to export data (CSV, PDF snapshot reports).
 12.2. In demo build, optionally badge “Prototype”/“Powered by Cursor” subtly in the footer.
How to Use With Cursor and Gemini:
