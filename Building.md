Based on the provided PRD and focusing solely on the requirements outlined, here is a detailed breakdown of the "Building" tab and its associated sections (People, Flats, Assets, and Suppliers), as data collection points:

Building Management Section (within the PRD's Feature Requirements)

This section of the PRD defines the need for organized repositories of information about the building itself and the entities associated with it. This information is fundamental to the operation of the entire application.

Core Concept: Building-Specific Data

All information within the People, Flats, Assets, and Suppliers sections must be scoped to the currently selected building. The application must ensure data segregation so that managers only see information relevant to the building they are actively managing.
1. People Management

Purpose: To maintain a comprehensive directory of all individuals affiliated with the building. This includes residents, other property managers with access to this specific building's data, and potentially other relevant contacts.
Key Data Points:
Individual's Name (First, Last)
Role (e.g., Resident, Manager)
Contact Information (Email, Phone Number)
Associated Flat Number(s) (for residents)
User Account Status (e.g., Active, Pending Approval)
Core Functionality Requirements:
Display a list of all people associated with the selected building.
Allow for the creation of new people records.
Enable editing of existing people records.
Support searching and filtering of the people list based on name, role, or other criteria.
Link people records to user accounts within the application's authentication system.
Potentially include functionality to manage user roles and permissions within the building context.
Integration: This data is used in the Ticketing System (Work Orders) to identify residents reporting issues and in communication features. It's also linked to the Flats data to associate residents with their units.
2. Flats Management

Purpose: To maintain a detailed record of all individual residential or commercial units within the building. This data is critical for financial calculations (service charges), work order tracking, and general building administration.
Key Data Points:
Flat Number or Identifier
Size (in square feet or other relevant unit)
Number of Bedrooms
Number of Bathrooms
Current Occupancy Status (e.g., Occupied, Vacant)
Associated Resident(s)
Service Charge Calculation Basis (e.g., per square foot)
Core Functionality Requirements:
Display a list of all flats within the selected building.
Allow for the creation of new flat records.
Enable editing of existing flat details.
Support searching and filtering of the flats list.
Integration with the Financial Management system to automatically calculate service charge demands based on configured rates and flat size.
Link flats to residents to track who lives where.
Potentially include fields for specific features or amenities of the flat.
3. Assets Management

Purpose: To create an inventory of significant physical assets within the building that require maintenance or tracking (e.g., communal boilers, elevators, fire alarms, roofing systems). This enables tracking of maintenance history and associating work orders with specific equipment.
Key Data Points:
Asset Name/Identifier
Description
Location within the building
Installation Date (if known)
Manufacturer and Model (if applicable)
Warranty Information (if applicable)
Maintenance Log/History (linked work orders)
Core Functionality Requirements:
Display a list of all registered assets within the selected building.
Allow for the creation of new asset records.
Enable editing of existing asset details.
Support searching and filtering of the assets list.
Provide a view of all past and current work orders linked to a specific asset.
Potentially include functionality for scheduling recurring maintenance tasks for assets.
4. Suppliers Management

Purpose: To maintain a vetted directory of external contractors and service providers who perform work on the building. This streamlines the process of requesting quotes and assigning work orders.
Key Data Points:
Supplier Name
Contact Information (Phone, Email, Address)
Specialties/Trades (e.g., Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Cleaning)
Insurance and Certification Details (if applicable)
Notes or Internal Ratings
History of work orders assigned to the supplier
Core Functionality Requirements:
Display a list of all approved suppliers associated with the selected building.
Allow for the creation of new supplier records.
Enable editing of existing supplier details.
Support searching and filtering of the suppliers list by name or specialty.
Integration with the Ticketing System to easily select and assign suppliers to work orders and request quotes.
Potentially include functionality for tracking supplier performance or ratings.
These four sections collectively form the "Building" data core, providing the foundational information necessary to manage a property effectively within the application. The requirements emphasize data organization, ease of access, and the ability to link these core entities to other features like work orders and financial management.
